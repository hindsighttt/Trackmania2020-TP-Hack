# Trackmania 2020 TP HACK

This is a python script using the pymem module to read the memory in order to get the coordinates and write to the memory to teleport the local player car





## Usage

To use the script, you must already have the game launched.

While you're in a map you can
    
    Press shift + t to teleport
        It will pause the game
        Open the hack instance again
        Then input the coordinates
        X:
        Y:
        Z:
        And press enter to teleport
        
    Press shift + y to get the current coordinates of the local player
        It will print the coordinates to the console like this
        X: 123.1
        Y: 1337
        Z: 66.6
